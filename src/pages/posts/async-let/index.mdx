This post might be a bit all over the place.
I currently have Covid-19 and the idea that I'm hoping to present is only half baked.
I'm hoping that I can get these ideas out of my head so that others might work out the
nitty details for me ðŸ¦€

## Corrections

Before I go into any detail about this new feature, I want to first clarify some of the points
from my [Stacked Futures](/posts/async-stack) post.

I regret this title now. I should have called it 'Scoped Spawning',
which was one idea I had about introducing more
[Structured Concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency) features to async Rust.

As many pointed out in later discussions,
async Rust definitely already has some structured concurrency in the form of
[`join`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/macro.join.html) or the more dynamic
[`FuturesUnordered`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.21/futures/stream/struct.FuturesUnordered.html) from the futures crate.

These are very powerful tools and allow structured concurrency today, but they don't make full use
of the current executor. For instance, if I place two futures in a join,
they are forced to run on the same task. That is, we have concurrency but no parallelism.
With my post, I was trying to determine a way to get structured concurrency through spawning
top level tasks - while not needing any new allocations.

## Async let

With that out of the way, I am focusing more atttention now to the structured concurrency
techniques we have available today - e.g. the `join` I mentioned above.

Let's start with an example. We want to make 2 http requests which are completely independent.

```rust
let resp1 = client.make_http_request(1).await;
let resp2 = client.make_http_request(2).await;
```

This works, but is wasteful.
async/await lets you model asynchronous operations as synchronous functions, but this is misleading.
These two HTTP requests still occur one after the other.

How we can fix this today? Well, we could spawn a new task in our runtime, but assuming we can't
share our client as `'static`, that's not always possible.

```rust
use futures::future::join; // joins 2 futures together, returning a new future

// these two http requests will run concurrently and not block each other.
let (resp1, resp2) = join(
    async { client.make_http_request(1).await },
    async { client.make_http_request(2).await },
).await;
```

This works fine, but it's really reminding me of some of the hacks we used to do
in Rust [pre-NLL](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2094-nll.md#problem-case-1-references-assigned-into-a-variable).
It used to be common to create a separate scope for your references such that they would be dropped at the end of the scope and not overlap
with future use.

Similarly, we've been forced here to make a new scoped block for our futures to run in. We aren't
free to start futures and await them where-ever we please.

It would be really nice if we could tell Rust that both of these HTTP requests are independent without
having to break out of our current block. Something like a non-lexical-async feature.

## Introducing async-let

Async-let is how I would imagine a non-lexical structured concurrency to take place.

```rust
async let req1 = client.make_http_request(1); // -------------+ req 1 is started here
                                              //              |
async let req2 = client.make_http_request(2); // --+          | req 2 is started here
                                              //   |          |
let resp1 = req1.await; // ------------------------|----------+ req 1 ends here
                                              //   |
let resp2 = req2.await; // ------------------------+            req 2 ends here
```

How does this work? First, we need to see how async/await works currently.

> A lot of the desugaring I will be covering is described and featured in my nightly crate [jenner](https://github.com/conradludgate/jenner).

First, `async {}` turns into a [`Generator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/trait.Generator.html).
Every time you encounter an `$expr.await`, this is desugared into a poll-loop that yields when
the poll returns pending:

```rust
{
    // turn this expression into a future
    let mut fut = IntoFuture::into_future($expr);
    // pin the future (safe because the generator it exists within must be pinned too)
    let mut pinned = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut fut) };
    loop {
        // poll the future
        match pinned.as_mut().poll(&mut *cx) {
            // break from the loop if we are finished
            Poll::Ready(r) => break r,
            // yield from the generator if we are not ready to progress yet
            Poll::Pending => {
                cx = yield Poll::Pending,
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That's basically all you need to know. The way the generators work underneath are quite complicated
so I won't be covering it. It's not necessary for this async-let concept though.

What `async let` tells this desugaring is that before any yields, we should first also poll
any 'registered' non-lexical async scopes.

Written another way, any `.await`s in between

```rust
async let req2 = /* ... */;
// ...
let resp2 = req2.await;
```

will also poll our `req2` future.
This allows our async requests to effectively happen in the background.

## The fine print

```rust
async let req1 = client.make_http_request(1);
```

desugars into

```rust
let mut req1 = MaybeDone::new(IntoFuture::into_future($expr));
let mut req1 = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut req1) };
```

> [`MaybeDone`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/967a9c94b34bb8f394db03b1d205831eddf6f589/library/core/src/future/join.rs#L148-L158)
is a type that allows us to reliably poll a future without worrying about when it might complete.

Whenever there's an `$expr.await` within the lifetime of an async-let, then that would instead be turned into

```diff
{
    // turn this expression into a future
    let mut fut = IntoFuture::into_future($expr);
    // pin the future (safe because the generator it exists within must be pinned too)
    let mut pinned = unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(&mut fut) };
    loop {
+       {
+           // Poll our background futures.
+           // We don't care about it's ready state.
+           let _ = req1.as_mut().poll(&mut *cx);
+       }
        // poll the future
        match pinned.as_mut().poll(&mut *cx) {
            // break from the loop if we are finished
            Poll::Ready(r) => break r,
            // yield from the generator if we are not ready to progress yet
            Poll::Pending => {
                cx = yield Poll::Pending,
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This can scale up for however many async-lets are defined in the current scope.

Finally, when you have `req1.await`, this would desugar as

```rust
loop {
    // poll other registered background futures here if any

    // poll the future
    match req1.as_mut().poll(&mut *cx) {
        // break from the loop if we are finished
        Poll::Ready(r) => break req1.take_output().unwrap(),
        // yield from the generator if we are not ready to progress yet
        Poll::Pending => {
            cx = yield Poll::Pending,
        }
    }
}
```

## try-async-let

If you're familiar with more complicated concurrency primitives. You'll know that
`join` is only one of many. Another primitive that rust libraries provide is `select`.

This polls multiple futures until only a single future is complete (this is known as race concurrency).
I've not got a full proposal built for something like that, but I have something close.

We can extend our async-let from being special syntax for `join`,
and have `try async let` be a `try_join` (another race concurrency primitive).

Here's an example, let's say we want to add a deadline to our http requests.

```rust
// try block allows scoping `?` behaviour
try {
    // `try await` is like `async let` where this future runs in the background.
    // however, if it completes before it's dropped, and it's value is an error,
    // then we exit early.
    try async let deadline = async {
        sleep(Duration::from_ms(100)).await;
        Err(DeadlineExceeded)
    };

    async let req1 = client.make_http_request(1);
    async let req2 = client.make_http_request(2);
    let resp1 = req1.await;
    let resp2 = req2.await;

    // Don't bother to await `deadline`. We want to continue instantly if we succeed
    (resp1, resp2)
}
```

We can even improve our http requests too, since we might expect network errors.
We might know we want to fail early if a single http request fails too,
we why don't we make those `try` as well

```rust
try {
    // this allow us to exit early in the event that we have network errors
    try async let req1 = client.make_http_request(1);
    try async let req2 = client.make_http_request(2);
    let resp1 = req1.await?;
    let resp2 = req2.await?;

    (resp1, resp2)
}
```

We can even use this for more than just errors by (ab)using the [Try trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Try.html).

```rust
try {
    enum Either<L, R> { Left(L), Right(R) }
    impl<L, R> Try for Either<L, R> {
        type Output = L;
        type Residual = Either<!, R>;
        /* ... */
    }

    async let req1 = client.make_http_request(1);

    // `Right` is our 'residual' so it would exit early if req2
    // completes first
    try async let req2 = async {
        Either::Right(client.make_http_request(2).await)
    };

    req1.await
    // if req1 compeletes first, we do not await req2.
}
```

This allows us to emulate the `select` race behaviour I mentioned above, all using `try async let`.
