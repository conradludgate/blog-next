I wanted to learn more about QUIC, the transport protocol behind HTTP/3. It's inspired by the learnings of HTTP/2. Some of the notable features:

1. The connection handshake and the TLS handshake occur together. Reducing a roundtrip.
2. With pre-shared keys, it supports zero-round-trip connections, which is useful for mobile network switchovers.
3. Connections have built-in support for multiplexing, which makes it straightforward to implement concurrent requests.

I was thinking about what I could implement that could take advantage of these functionalities. I'm not too sure how I can take advantage of point 2 above,
but point 3 made me think of another protocol that I am familiar with, the Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP) as implemented by RabbitMQ.

AMQP has a channel abstraction, which is for multiplexed connections. This allows you to consume from multiple queues without having multiple connections open.

So, that's what I'm going to experiment with. Writing my own message broker in Rust using QUIC.

## Prior setup

I'm going to use [`quinn`](https://docs.rs/quinn/latest/quinn/index.html) which is inspired from the implementation of [`h2`](https://docs.rs/h2/latest/h2/).
Since `quinn` makes strict assumptions about [`rustls`](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/), I will also lean into it and use mTLS for authentication, instead of using an additional username and password flow.

I am using [`rcgen`](https://docs.rs/rcgen/latest/rcgen/) to generate the certifications that I know will work with `rustls`.

## Starting point

I want to make sure that my mTLS setup and `quinn` works properly, so start off by experimenting with creating a connection and a stream, and writing data.
It wasn't too hard, you have to create an `Endpoint` on both sides, one using a `ClientConfig` and one using a `ServerConfig`.

On the server you can `accept()` connection requests, which gives you a `Connecting` struct.
Spawn that off to a `tokio` task and await it to establish the TLS authenticated connection.

On the client, you can `connect` to a socket address which similarly returns a `Connecting`.
Await that, and if the TLS hostname is correct and the certificates are validated, the connection will be ready to use.

On both sides now, it's possible to use `accept_bi` and `open_bi` to open new sub-connections, called 'streams' in QUIC. This returns on both sides a
`SendStream` and a `RecvStream` which implement `AsyncWrite` and `AsyncRead` respectively. What caught me out at first is that stream open requests are buffered.
If you open a bi-directional stream on the client, the server will not be notified of that stream until you `flush()` the stream.
This is part of what makes streams so lightweight. Once I figured out that you had to use `flush()` or `finish()`, I was able to get a quick echo example
working.
