I've known about HyperLogLog for a while, but I never found a use in my day-to-day work until recently.

## Problem

At my day job, I wanted to estimate the number of users that connect in any given hour window in each region.
I wanted to determine the size that a new cache should be. Now, we could have some dynamic cache scaling or
run a binary search over several deployment windows, but I wanted to make an educated guess first.

Unfortunately, it wasn't easy to count the distinct users. We log all user sessions into Grafana Loki, so I put together this query as a quick hack

```promql
count(
	sum(
        count_over_time(
            {service="xyz"}
                |= "request from"
                |  regexp `user=(?P<user>[^\,\}]+)`
            [1h]
	    )
    ) by (region, user)
) without (user)
```

I'm not going to explain how the query works, but I will demonstrate how bad it is by quoting the stats while running this range over 24 hours:

| label                      | value      |
|----------------------------|------------|
| bytes processed per second | 48.2 GB/s  |
| lines processed per second | 188124380  |
| total bytes processed      | 520 GB     |
| total lines processed      | 2027261473 |
| exec time                  | 10.8 s     |

Kudos to Grafana Cloud for managing to process 48GB/s, but this is not a good solution. I got my answer though so I guess that's it?

Well, this is a re-occurring problem. I frequently need to estimate the count along different metrics. How many users are using this API?
How many users see this specific error? etc.

## HyperLogLog

HyperLogLog is a probabilistic estimate for the cardinality of a set. It's surprisingly accurate.

The idea: a hash of the user ID would be an effectively random string of bits
```rust
hash("conradludgate") = 0b0000111000000110100000101101101010101110010010000101101111001100
```

Let's hash all the letters of the alphabet and see if we spot any patterns.

```

It might be easier to see patterns if we also sort them:

```

Exactly half of all the hash outputs start with a `1` (13/26). <br />
About a quarter of all the hash outputs start with `01` (7/26). <br />
A little over an eighth of all the hash outputs start with `001` (4/26).

This is a property of a uniformly random output. Each bit has a 1/2 chance of being a 0.
Because each bit should have no relationship to the last, they are mutually exclusive.
To calculate probabilities of two mutually exclusive events you can multiply their individual
probabilities. So getting `01...` would be `1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4` and getting `001` would be `1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.
Rephrasing this statement, after 8 distinct hashes, we expect one of them to have `001` at the start.
After 64 distinct hashes, we expect one of them to have `000001` at the start.
After 65536 distinct hashes, we expect one of them to have `0000000000000001` at the start.

What we can then do is take the maximum length run we find and use that as our cardinality estimate. If we see a `0000000000000001` we
can count the 15 zeroes. Our estimate for how many elements we have hashes is then on the order of `2^(15+1) = 65536` elements.

Being stuck to a single power of two for our estimate is quite limiting though, and we have the chance to be unlucky and get 15 zeroes on
our first hash. To alleviate this issue, we can store a few different counts. Use the last few bits of the hash output as an index into
a specific shard, and then store the max count we observe in that shard. Eg, taking the hash of my name:

```
0000111000000110100000101101101010101110010010000101101111001100
^^^^ run of 4                                               ^^^^ index 12

shards[12] = max(shards[12], 4);
```

To calculate our estimate, we can get the average estimate of all the buckets. In this case, the harmonic mean performs the most accurately.

```
1 / shards.map(|run_len| 2^-(run_len + 1)).sum()
```

## Insertion is Commutative and Associative

A very nice feature of the insert operation is that it's both commutative and associative. What that means is that

```
(((a + b) + c) + d)
```

can be rewritten as

```
(a + b) + (c + d)
```

This means you do not have to have a single linear stream to perform the aggregation. You can have multiple streams pre-aggregate this HyperLogLog
estimate, and then merge them later. Merging is performed simply by taking the max of each shard.

### HLL for distributed systems

Because you can merge the HLL streams from multiple places, and get consistent results, there needs to be no synchronisation
of the state between services. Each service can maintain its own HLL and publish it. Later, a separate service can collect all the HLL states
and merge them.

### HLL over time

We don't even benefit just from distributing this state across space, but you can distribute it across time. This has some very neat implications.
If you regularly reset the counters after publishing them, you can merge a specific time range and analyze that time range specifically.

For instance, Every 5 minutes, publish the current state and reset. To analyze the last hour, you can take the last 12 state samples and merge them.

## Prometheus Rust implementation

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct HyperLogLog<const N: usize> {
    core: Arc<HyperLogLogCore<N>>,
}

struct HyperLogLogCore<const N: usize> {
    shards: [AtomicU8; N],
}

impl<const N: usize> HyperLogLog<N> {
    pub fn measure(&self, item: &impl Hash) {
        self.record(BuildHasherDefault::<xxh3::Hash64>::default().hash_one(item));
    }

    fn record(&self, hash: u64) {
        assert!(N.is_power_of_two());
        let p = N.ilog2() as u8;
        let j = hash & (N as u64 - 1); // N - 1 gets a mask of the last `p` bits since N is a power of two.
        let rho = hash.leading_zeros() as u8 + 1;
        self.core.shards[j as usize].fetch_max(rho, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed);
    }

    fn collect(&self) -> Vec<u8> {
        self.core
            .shards
            .iter()
            .map(|shard| {
                shard.swap(0, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed)
            })
            .collect()
    }
}
```

This implementation of HyperLogLog collector can be added into a [prometheus collector trait](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon/blob/16717ff13a3db7210c064521f72442ed7379f3d5/libs/metrics/src/hll.rs) as multiple gauges.

```
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=0} = 5
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=1} = 10
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=2} = 7
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=3} = 8
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=4} = 5
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=5} = 3
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=6} = 1
my_metrics_total_hll{hll_shard=7} = 2
```

When scraped into prometheus, it can be aggregated using the following query:

```promql
1 / (
    sum (
        2 ^ -(
            # HLL merge operation
            max (my_metrics_total_hll{}) by (hll_shard, region)
        )
    ) without (hll_shard)
)
* alpha
* shards_count
* shards_count
```

## Performance

Running a 32 shard version in our a preview environment, running this over a days worth of 15s samples, it takes only 150ms.
I haven't yet measured how much storage this takes, but a quick estimate:

`6 bits per number * 32 numbers per sample * 4 samples per minute * 1440 minutes per day = 135KiB`.
This does assume perfect compression, and only accounts for a single label.

Assuming our use case, with at most 6 active pods per region, 8 regions, and 12 different label groupings, we would expect to accumulate
only 75MiB of data a day. Even if the compression was not good and the size was double, this would still be insignificant compared to the scale of our logs.
