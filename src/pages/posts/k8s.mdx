This is the tale of my many years of deploying apps to the internet.
From my humble beginnings to automatic deployment and service management.

## In the beginning, there was TMUX

My first ever website I think was some raw HTML and JS running on an Apache Server on my home Windows desktop.

But fast forward a few years, I had started to develop some web-apps written in [Go](https://golang.org) and I wanted to deploy them.
I ended up paying 10â‚¬/month for a VPS with 8GB of memory that could also double as a game server box to share with my friends.

I ran Minecraft, Terarria and my own web servers on there, all within glourious [tmux sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux).
If you don't know, tmux (**t**erminal **mu**ltiple**x**er) is a tool that lets you have multiple shell sessions open at once, in the background,
and they survive through logins. It would let me log into my VPS, open the tmux sessions to view my deployments and then I could log out and
those sessions would still be running.

I used [nginx reverse proxies](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) for subdomain routing
and SSL termination (through [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/))

It was beautifully simple to deploy a new app. Since I ran Arch Linux both on my home PC and on my VPS, the runtime
requirements were basically the same. I used this system for a few years, but it did have some problems...

My main language of choice was Go, which is a pretty straight forward language to compile, it downloads the dependencies for you and compiles to a static binary,
so no [DLL/SO hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell). But sometimes I would run Python too.
Dependencies in python are not as simple since they need to be available in the system, and if two applications need different versions of the same dependency,
that's awkward to deal with

## Then there was Docker

When I heard about docker, I instantly understood the selling point. You don't just compile the code, but also the environment it will run in.
Also, I don't need to worry about tmux anymore and my programs closing when I log out because docker will run in the background. It was the perfect system.

I would build my web app, bundle it into a docker image, upload it to my server and then run the docker container. Simple!

I kept my nginx setup from before. I still needed subdomain routing and SSL and Docker didn't provide that for me.

This setup was fine. I would use docker compose for some more involved projects that required databases.

## Welcome Terraform

By this point, I had started working as a developer full time and I had really come to love automated deployment strategies and automated infrastructure.
I decided I'd try my hand at automating some of my deployments.

I decided to give up on my trusty nginx and give [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) a spin. Configuring nginx was a bit cumbersome.
I'd go into the config folder, copy an existing website template, update the domains and proxy port, restart nginx, run certbot. That was a lot of effort.
I tried to automate it a bit with some dodgy bash scripts but that workflow didn't really last.

What Caddy brought to the table was an api to configure it, and automatic SSL through letsencrypt, no need to run certbot.
This meant I could run 1 command and have my reverse proxy up in just under a minute.

I had previously dabbled in writing a [terraform provider for the Spotify API](https://github.com/conradludgate/terraform-provider-spotify)
so I realised I could use this knowledge and create a [terraform provider for Caddy too](https://github.com/conradludgate/terraform-provider-caddy).

That combined with a [terraform provider for Docker](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest), I had a simple set of config files
that I could modify and simply run `terraform apply` to deploy a new app or a new update.

The only issue here is that Caddy has quite bad documentation, and I was writing the terraform provider myself so it ended up being quite limited.
Combine that with the fact that the docker provider would also sometimes timeout and containers would be deployed but not tracked,
I would have to log in from time to time and clean up the deployment.

It wasn't perfect, but when it worked, I felt quite proud at what I had made.

## So long Terraform, Here comes Dokku

But it wasn't perfect. I had suffered through it for a while, updating the caddy provider a few times before finding myself on a long train journey reading about
[Dokku](https://dokku.com/). Now, I have _applications_ as a first class item that I could configure, with SSL, domain names, etc.
I would `git push` my repositories with Dockerfiles to my Dokku server, Dokku would deploy or update the application. Very easy.

This would have been the end of this blog post if my dokku setup didn't have a crucial flaw. If my VPS crashed, I would need to restart it, and for some reason,
my applications would not automatically start, and they would not have SSL configured anymore.

This really sucked. Once I deployed an application, I wouldn't want to give it attention as to how it was deployed.
My previous setups involving docker, nginx, caddy would be self restarting.

This setup ended up being my least used, even though I really wanted to like it. It really seemed great but I just couldn't get used to that annoyance.

## And for our grand finale

In my work I had played around with this ['kubernetes' thing](https://kubernetes.io/). It seemed like the solution for deploying apps on a large scale with
load balancing, auto scaling, resource management, cluster support across many machines. A complicated setup, definitely not something for me running just a couple apps with
no need for scaling or load balancing.

It turns out it's definitely for that!

I decided to stop delaying the inevitable and take some courses on k8s. I realise that it's actually quite simple. The configuration files aren't anything more than
I had previously setup myself.

I gave my server a fresh installation, ran `minikube start --driver=ssh ...` and got a single node cluster running in a single morning<Footnote tag="1"/>.

With my new found knowledge, I got all my previous applications up and running in not a long time. With Prometheus and Grafana being even easier to setup
than it was on Dokku.

<Footnote tag="1">I had some issues with debian initially. Ubuntu worked well in the end</Footnote>

## This is not the end

I'm sure I'm gonna change things up soon enough. There's a lot of kubernetes tooling out there and the ecosystem is changing all the time.
Maybe I'll try out Nomad. Maybe a completely different application paradigm will launch and I'll abandon ship.

I'm very thankful for what I got to learn along the way. Every new system I have set up has taught me something new, slowing getting me
to where I am today. I still put more effort into my applications rather than my devops, but it's still a skill I like to have.
