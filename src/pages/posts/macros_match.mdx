I've written a lot of macros. I've even written macros professionally.
If there's one thing I'd have to say about macros is that they're hard to write effectively.
However, this is my blog, I'm allowed to say as much about macros as I like.

Even if I don't recommend people write them, I'm not stopping any time soon.
So I'm starting this series documenting some of the design patterns
that help write effective macros.

<Rq>...</Rq>

Anyway. If, like me, you're naturally curious about how macros work, you might have looked at the `cargo expand`
of some of the built in derives.

Here's an example

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Account {
    user: String,
    money: i32,
}
```

(follow along at home on the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=337cfa59b540fd767e146fc216967366), using the 'Tools > Expand Macros' feature)

When we `cargo expand` this, we get the following

```rust
impl ::core::fmt::Debug for Account {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::core::fmt::Formatter) -> ::core::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            Self { user: ref __self_0_0, money: ref __self_0_1 } => {
                let debug_trait_builder = &mut ::core::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct(f, "Account");
                let _ = ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "user", &&(*__self_0_0));
                let _ = ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "money", &&(*__self_0_1));
                ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::finish(debug_trait_builder)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Hmm. This is a lot of code. And it's a bit of a mess. Ok, let's back up a bit.
If we implement it manually following the [docs examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html#examples)

```rust
impl fmt::Debug for Account {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        f.debug_struct("Account")
            .field("user", &self.user)
            .field("money", &self.money)
            .finish()
    }
}
```

This is much cleaner. Why does the derive output have _so much noise_?!
This code as presented is pretty straight forward to implement a macro for.
But with simplicity there is always hidden complexity.

## Structs

One of the issues you bump into early on with derive macros is that there's just so many ways to define structs.

```rust
struct UnitStruct;
struct TupleStruct(A, B, C);
struct NamedStruct {
    a: A,
    b: B,
    c: C,
}
```

If you're gonna support derives on structs, it usually makes sense to support all 3 forms.

For our `Debug` code, let's look at some idiomatic impls for each of these 3 structs

```rust
impl fmt::Debug for UnitStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        f.write_str("UnitStruct")
    }
}
impl fmt::Debug for TupleStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        f.debug_tuple("TupleStruct")
            .field(&self.0)
            .field(&self.1)
            .field(&self.2)
            .finish()
    }
}
impl fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        f.debug_struct("NamedStruct")
            .field("a", &self.a)
            .field("b", &self.b)
            .field("c", &self.c)
            .finish()
    }
}
```

Ok, maybe this isn't so bad. We have three different requirements of how we write the impl
(using `write_str`, `debug_tuple` and `debug_struct` respectively)
so maybe it makes sense that we need to duplicate our impl code depending
on what struct form we have been given.

## Enums

In our Rust world, not only do we have structs, we have enums too!
Each variant of an enum also has 3 forms (equivalent to the struct forms).

```rust
enum Enum {
    UnitVariant,
    TupleVariant(A, B, C),
    NamedVariant {
        a: A,
        b: B,
        c: C,
    },
}
```

which could have the following `Debug` impl

```rust
impl fmt::Debug for Enum {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            Enum::UnitVariant => f.write_str("UnitVariant"),
            Enum::TupleVariant(a, b, c) => {
                f.debug_tuple("TupleVariant")
                    .field(a)
                    .field(b)
                    .field(c)
                    .finish()
            },
            Enum::NamedVariant{a, b, c} => {
                f.debug_struct("NamedVariant")
                    .field("a", a)
                    .field("b", b)
                    .field("c", c)
                    .finish()
            },
        }
    }
}
```

Hmm. Ok, so the unit variant impl looks identical to the unit struct impl.
But the `TupleStruct` and `TupleVariant`, also the `NamedStruct` and `NamedVariant` impls look a little different.
Notice we no longer can use `&self.xxx` in our field args, instead we need to use the values from the match arms.

## Pattern matching

So, a neat thing of rust is that you can use patterns outside of match statements. Take a look at this

```rust
impl fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        let NamedStruct { a, b, c } = self;
        f.debug_struct("NamedStruct")
            .field("a", a)
            .field("b", b)
            .field("c", c)
            .finish()
    }
}
```

Now, wouldn't you know. This makes our struct impl almost identical to our enum impl!

It's just a shame we still need to use a match statement for the enums and a let pattern for the structs...

Well, what's stopping us from using a match in both cases?

```rust
impl fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            NamedStruct { a, b, c } => {
                f.debug_struct("NamedStruct")
                    .field("a", a)
                    .field("b", b)
                    .field("c", c)
                    .finish()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There we go. This is the match design pattern. I'm not sure if it has an official name,
but I've only learnt of it recently. It's a very nice one.

This is probably worthy of it's own article. Maybe even a book. But for the sake of completeness,
I'll explain all the differences between what I showed just now, and what you see from the built in derive.

## Match Ergnomics

Rust didn't always have amazing match ergnomics. Back in the early days, you would use `ref` patterns to
capture a field as a borrow from the match.

```diff
impl fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
-        match self {
-            NamedStruct { a, b, c } => {
+        match *self {
+            NamedStruct { ref a, ref b, ref c } => {
        }
    }
}
```

> _sigh_, reusing jokes from the last article

<Rq>So what, not like anyone read that one anyway...</Rq>

One thing you see a lot in derives is the use of fully qualified paths. There's many reasons for this.

First, let's say the user hasn't got `use std::fmt` in their code, but has their own `mod fmt {}`.
`fmt::Debug` would refer to their module, not ours! This is a problem. To solve this, replace all cases with
`::std::fmt`. This ensures that the fmt name **must** come from the `std` crate.

```diff
-impl fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
-    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
+impl ::std::fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
+    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter) -> ::std::fmt::Result {
    }
}
```

## Method call syntax is magic

Rust magically turns all method calls like

```rust
f.debug_struct("NamedStruct")
```

into

```rust
::std::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct(f, "NamedStruct")
```

In this case, it's guarnateed. But some macros might make use of trait methods.
These can become ambiguous very quickly. This also has the feature of autoref, which is a very
powerful tool to be used with case. So it should be avoided in macros if you want to be the most versatile.

```diff
impl ::std::fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter) -> ::std::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            NamedStruct { ref a, ref b, ref c } => {
-                f.debug_struct("NamedStruct")
-                    .field("a", a)
-                    .field("b", b)
-                    .field("c", c)
-                    .finish()
+                let debug_trait_builder = &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct(f, "NamedStruct");
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "a", a);
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "b", b);
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "c", c);
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::finish(debug_trait_builder)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Identifiers

In the case of our tuple structs. We had to invent identifiers for our fields.
We conveniently picked `(a, b, c)` but these are kinda arbitrary. Let's just generate numeral based idents
like `__self_0_0` (this is interpreted as `self > variant 0 > field 0`). For consistency, let's use these for our
named fields too

```diff
impl ::std::fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter) -> ::std::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
-            NamedStruct { ref a, ref b, ref c } => {
+            NamedStruct { a: ref __self_0_0, b: ref __self_0_1, c: ref __self_0_2 } => {
                let debug_trait_builder = &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct(f, "NamedStruct");
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "a", a);
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "b", b);
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "c", c);
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "a", __self_0_0);
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "b", __self_0_1);
+                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "c", __self_0_2);
                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::finish(debug_trait_builder)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## no_std

The last change is to support no_std environments. `fmt` is implemented in `core`.
This means our macro should use the `core` crate for full correctness.

```diff
-impl ::std::fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
-    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter) -> ::std::fmt::Result {
+impl ::core::fmt::Debug for NamedStruct {
+    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut ::core::fmt::Formatter) -> ::core::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            NamedStruct { a: ref __self_0_0, b: ref __self_0_1, c: ref __self_0_2 } => {
-                let debug_trait_builder = &mut ::std::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct(f, "NamedStruct");
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "a", __self_0_0);
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "b", __self_0_1);
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "c", __self_0_2);
-                ::std::fmt::DebugStruct::finish(debug_trait_builder)
+                let debug_trait_builder = &mut ::core::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct(f, "NamedStruct");
+                ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "a", __self_0_0);
+                ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "b", __self_0_1);
+                ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::field(debug_trait_builder, "c", __self_0_2);
+                ::core::fmt::DebugStruct::finish(debug_trait_builder)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## That's all folks

The only difference between our final code and the one that the built in macro outputs
is this `&&(*__self_0_0)` expression. As far as I'm aware, this is useless. `__self_0_0` works fine.
There are a couple decisions that come to this though. The rustc macro helpers automatically create the
`__self_0_0` idents for you in the match arms and give you `*__self_0_0` as the expression to use automatically.
So for the `field` functions where it needs a reference, you need to make it `&*__self_0_0`. The double reference
seems to be an oversight, but it's not harmful.
