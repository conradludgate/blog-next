It's been 9 months since my last blog post and I've decided to rewrite my blog front end.

My blog was originally setup using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
While I really liked that the site was a static set of files, I found customising Hugo quite a bit of work.

I've moved to using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) instead, hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home).
I feel this setup gives me the flexibility of React, while giving me the power of having a fast/static generated site.

I don't expect this rewrite will inspire me to write more blog posts, but I do have an idea I want to write about, so expect one soon :)

That's all from me ðŸ‘‹
